# KG ImageViewer #
This is a demo application, created by Kjeld Groot.

### Good to know ###

* To run the app, you first have to run a CocoaPods install to install the libraries used in this project. I didn't push the Pod files to prevent unnecessary files in the repository.
* The code is written in Swift 2.0, so you need Xcode 7.0 or higher to run the project.
* I used the 500px API to get the images.
