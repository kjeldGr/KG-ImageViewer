# Blendle Assignment #
This is an assignment made by Kjeld Groot for the company Blendle.

### Good to know ###

* To run the app, you first have to run a CocoaPods install to install the libraries used in this project. I didn't push the Pod files to prevent unnecessary files in the repository.
* The code is written in Swift 2.0, so you need Xcode 7.0 or higher to run the project.
* I merged the develop branch into the master branch, so they are the same at this moment.
